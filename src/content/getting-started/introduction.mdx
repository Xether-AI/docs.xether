# Introduction to Xether AI

Xether AI is a data infrastructure platform built for AI-native teams. It automates the complex work of ingesting, cleaning, validating, and versioning datasets — so your models always train on high-quality data.

## What Xether AI Does

At its core, Xether AI gives you:

- Automated Pipelines — Define data pipelines in YAML or JSON. Xether handles execution, retries, and monitoring.
- Dataset Versioning — Every dataset mutation creates an immutable version. Roll back, compare, or branch at any time.
- Lineage Tracking — Know exactly where your data came from and how it was transformed.
- ML-Native Services — Built-in outlier detection and synthetic data generation, ready to use in any pipeline.
- Multi-Source Connectors — Connect to S3, Snowflake, PostgreSQL, and more with minimal configuration.

## Who Is It For?

| Role                | How Xether AI Helps                                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Engineers      | Build and schedule pipelines without writing boilerplate infrastructure code |
| ML Engineers       | Get clean, versioned datasets with full lineage for reproducible training    |
| Data Scientists    | Explore dataset versions and generate synthetic data for experimentation     |

## Core Concepts

Before diving in, familiarise yourself with these key concepts:

- Dataset — A named, versioned collection of data. Can be a file, table, or stream.
- Pipeline — A directed sequence of stages that transforms a dataset.
- Stage — A single processing step in a pipeline (ingest, clean, validate, transform, augment).
- Version — An immutable snapshot of a dataset at a point in time.
- Lineage — The full history of how a dataset was created and transformed.

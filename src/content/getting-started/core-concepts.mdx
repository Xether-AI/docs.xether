# Understanding Core Concepts

Xether AI is built around a small set of powerful primitives. Understanding these will help you design better pipelines and get the most out of the platform.

## Datasets

A **dataset** is a named, versioned collection of data. It can represent:

- A CSV or Parquet file in S3
- A table in Snowflake or PostgreSQL
- A real-time data stream
- A synthetic dataset generated by Xether AI

Datasets are the central unit of work in Xether AI. Every pipeline reads from and writes to datasets.

```python
# Create a dataset
dataset = client.datasets.create(
    name="customer-records",
    tags=["production", "crm"],
    schema={
        "fields": [
            {"name": "id", "type": "string"},
            {"name": "email", "type": "string"},
            {"name": "created_at", "type": "timestamp"}
        ]
    }
)
```

## Pipelines

A **pipeline** is a directed sequence of stages that processes a dataset. Pipelines are defined declaratively in YAML or JSON, and Xether AI handles execution, scheduling, and monitoring.

```
Dataset → [Ingest] → [Clean] → [Validate] → [Transform] → [Augment] → Versioned Dataset
```

      <TableCell className="font-medium font-mono">augment</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Enrich with external data or ML predictions</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

## Versions

Every time a pipeline runs successfully, it creates a new **version** of the output dataset. Versions are:

- **Immutable** — once created, a version never changes
- **Addressable** — reference any version by ID or tag (e.g., `latest`, `v1.2.0`)
- **Comparable** — diff any two versions to see what changed

```python
# List all versions
versions = client.datasets.list_versions("customer-records")

# Get a specific version
v2 = client.datasets.get_version("customer-records", "v2")

# Compare two versions
diff = client.datasets.diff("customer-records", "v1", "v2")
print(f"Added: {diff.added_rows}, Removed: {diff.removed_rows}")
```

## Lineage

**Lineage** tracks the full history of how a dataset was created and transformed. Xether AI automatically records:

- Which source datasets were used
- Which pipeline stages were applied
- Which pipeline version ran
- Who triggered the run and when

```python
# Get full lineage for a dataset version
lineage = client.datasets.get_lineage("customer-records", "latest")
print(lineage.to_json())
```

## Connectors

**Connectors** are integrations with external data sources. Xether AI ships with built-in connectors for:

- **Object Storage**: S3, GCS, Azure Blob
- **Data Warehouses**: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
- **APIs**: REST, GraphQL (via custom connectors)

## Executions

An **execution** is a single run of a pipeline. Each execution has:

- A unique ID
- A status (`pending`, `running`, `succeeded`, `failed`)
- Logs for each stage
- Metrics (rows processed, duration, errors)

```python
# Get execution details
execution = client.executions.get("exec_abc123")
print(f"Status: {execution.status}")
print(f"Duration: {execution.duration_seconds}s")
```
